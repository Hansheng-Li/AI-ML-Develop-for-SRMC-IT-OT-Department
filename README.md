# AI & ML for SRMC IT/OT Department
## Mirwaise Aurah, CIO of SRMC, states the goal:

Applying AI and Machine Learning methodologies to collaborate with our IT/OT team, unlocking the full potential of AI and ML, and propelling Savannah River Mission Completion (SRMC) forward.

## SRMC is responsible for a wide range of critical tasks, including:

- Liquid Waste Stabilization and Disposition
- Nuclear Materials Management and Stabilization
- Project Management and Support Services
- Storage of Liquid Radioactive Waste
- Remediation, Treatment, and Disposal of Nuclear Materials and Spent Nuclear Fuel
- Remediation and Treatment of Contaminated Surface Water, Groundwater, and Soils
- Decontamination of Nuclear Facilities and Equipment
  
## Liquid Waste System Plan Summary

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Goal**: Complete the processing and closure of the Liquid Waste (LW) system at the Savannah River Site (SRS) by the end of 2037.
- **Recent Progress**: The Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) has been operational, processing over 5 million gallons of dissolved salt solution. The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) has produced 4,319 glass canisters from April 1996 to September 2022, with a projected total of 8,100 canisters over the project lifecycle.

## 2. Planning Summary and Results
- **Waste Retrieval**: Uses mechanical agitation pumps to suspend solids and transfer waste for further processing.
- **Sludge Processing**: Involves low-temperature aluminum dissolution, blending and washing, feeding to DWPF, and vitrification.
- **DWPF Operations**: Combines washed sludge with high-level waste streams from salt processing for vitrification into glass canisters. Plans to process 325 canisters per year, with an assumed melter replacement in early FY29.
- **Salt Processing**: Continues using SWPF to process salt waste, with completion expected by 2035.

## 3. System Description
- **Tank Storage and Waste Removal**: Employs methods like Drain, Add, Remove (DAR) and Commercial Submersible Mixing Pumps (CSMP) for waste dissolution and transfer.
- **Safe Disposal of Waste**: Involves vitrification at DWPF and solidification into saltstone at the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF), followed by tank closure and decontamination of auxiliary equipment.

## 4. Modeling the LW System
- **Purpose**: To predict system performance, identify bottlenecks, and find improvement opportunities.
- **Models Used**: AWSM II and Process Optimization Model (POM) developed by DBD Inc., using AnyLogic and gPROMS software to simulate logistics and chemical processes.
- **Results**: Over 100 scenarios were modeled, with 35 achieving the 2037 completion objective. Improvements include increasing SWPF filtration rate, reducing MST strike time and quantity, and increasing CSSX throughput.
