## Build CNN from Scratch

### Overview
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch. A CNN is a deep learning algorithm that can take in an input image, assign importance to various aspects/objects in the image, and differentiate one from the other.

### Layers Explained
1. **Convolutional Layer**: Extracts features from the input data using convolutional filters to capture local patterns.
2. **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining important features. Common types are Max Pooling and Average Pooling.
3. **Fully Connected Layer**: Uses extracted features for classification or regression tasks, typically implemented as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

## Kalman Filter and YOLOv5 for Tracking Balls in Video

### Overview
This project uses a combination of Kalman Filter and YOLOv5 to track balls in video footage. YOLOv5 detects the balls, while the Kalman Filter is used to predict and smooth the detected object's trajectory.

## Maximum Likelihood

### Overview
This project explores the concept of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model. MLE aims to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the observations given the parameters.
